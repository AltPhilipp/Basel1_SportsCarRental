## Analysis

### Scenario

The Sportscar Rental Project is a web application for a generic sportscar rental company. Users are able to rent vehicles from a selection at a given date and time. Insurance Packages can be selected with a vehicle rental. Admin users can add, remove and edit vehicles.

### User Stories: 

#### Insurance Packages:
- As a user, I want to view different insurance packages available for my rental, so that I can select the package that best matches my risk preferences and budget.

- As an administrator, I want to add new insurance packages to the system, so that I can offer more choices to our users based on their needs and feedback. 

- As an administrator, I want to update details of existing insurance packages, so that I can ensure the information is current and accurate. 

- As an administrator, I want to delete outdated insurance packages, so that users are only presented with relevant options. 

#### Racetracks:  
- As a user, I want to browse through available racetracks, so that I can select a track that suits my driving skills and preferences. 

- As an administrator, I want to add new racetracks, so that users have access to more options for their driving experiences. 

- As an administrator, I want to update information on existing racetracks, so that the listings stay accurate and informative.

- As an administrator, I want to delete racetracks that are no longer available, to keep the platform updated and avoid confusion for the users. 

#### Cars: 
- As a user, I want to view a list of available sports cars, so that I can choose a car that excites me and meets my performance expectations. 

- As an administrator, I want to add new sports cars to our inventory, so that I can provide a wider range of choices to our users. 

- As an administrator, I want to update the details of the sports cars in our inventory, so that all the specifications and availability are correct.

- As an administrator, I want to delete sports cars from our inventory that are no longer for rent, to ensure our users see only those cars that they can book.

- As an administrator, I want to make cars unavailable for booking, to ensure customer cannont select cars during the booking process which are beeing maintained.

#### User Management: 
- As a user, I want to browse all the information on the website without needing to create an account, so that I can freely explore the available options.

- As a user, I want to make a booking without needing to create an account, so that I can quickly and easily arrange my driving experience.

- As an administrator, I want to manage all information about cars, insurance packages, and racetracks, so that I can keep the system up to date and accurate.
  
- As an administrator, I want to log into my account, so that I can access the admin-only section to perform tasks related to car management and booking oversight.
  
#### Booking: 
- As a user, I want to select a date and time for my booking, so that I can schedule my driving experience at my convenience.

- As a user, I want to choose a sports car, a racetrack, and an insurance package as part of my booking, so that I can customize my experience to my preferences.
  
- As a user, I want to provide my full name and driver's license ID when making a booking, so that my identity and eligibility can be verified.

- As an administrator, I want to view all bookings, so that I can manage and oversee the reservations made by visitors.

- As an administrator, I want to edit bookings, so that I can update or correct details as needed.

### Use Case:
As discussed with you lecturers we do not have to provide both user stories and use cases as one is enough.

## Design
We have decided to stay with the sleek modern feel that budibase default uses. For the logo we also chose a sleek and simplistic design of a sportscar, fitting the brand image.

### Wireframes

### Prototype
Using Visily, we created some very aspirational prototypes. These can be viewed here:

https://app.visily.ai/projects/319f7cef-5aa7-4a63-bd4b-797c76e071ab/boards/863487

### Domain Design
The `ch.fhnw.sportscarrental.data.domain` package contains the following domain objects/entities including getters and setters:

The domain model for the Sportscar Rental system consists of the following entities:

#### InsurancePackage:
Represents an insurance package with the following attributes: insuranceID, insuranceName, insuranceDescription, insuranceDeductible, and insurancePrice.
#### Booking:
Represents a booking which includes bookingID, bookingDate, bookingTime, bookingCarName (selected Car), bookingRacetrackName, bookingInsurancePackageName, bookingFirstname, bookingLastname, and bookingDriverLicenseID.
#### Car:
Represents a car available for rent including the following attributes: carID, carName, carDetails, carImageURL, carLicensePlate, carRate, and carAvailable (true or false).
#### Racetrack:
Represents a racetrack where the rented cars can be driven, including the following attributes: trackID, trackName, trackDescription, trackLength, and trackLocation.

Each booking must contain exactly one insurance package, one selected car, and one selected race track.
An insurance package and a race track can be included in zero or many bookings.
A car can be included in zero or one booking (e.g., if a car is not booked or being maintained).

### Business Logic 
User story (Cars): As an administrator, I want to make cars unavailable for booking, to ensure customer cannont select cars during the booking process which are beeing maintained. Therefor if the availability of a car is set as "false" the car cannot be selected by the user during the booking process.

Based on the UC-4, there will be two offers and a standard offer. Given a location, a message is shown accordingly:

- If the location is "Basel", the message is "10% off on all large pizzas!!!"
- If the location is "Brugg", the message is "two for the price of One on all small pizzas!!!"
- Otherwise, the message is "No special offer".

**Path**: [`/api/menu/?location="Basel"`] 

**Param**: `value="location"` Admitted value: "Basel","Brugg".

**Method:** `GET`

## Implementation

### Backend Technology
This Web application is relying on [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot) and the following dependencies:

- [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot)
- [Spring Data](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data)
- [Java Persistence API (JPA)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/persistence-jsp-140049.html)
- [H2 Database Engine](https://www.h2database.com)

To bootstrap the application, the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) has been used.

Then, the following further dependencies have been added to the project `pom.xml`:

- DB:
```XML
<dependency>
			<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
			<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
			<scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
```

- SWAGGER:
```XML
   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
      <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
      <version>2.3.0</version>
   </dependency>
```

### Frontend Technology
The Frontend was developed using Budibase.

> ðŸš§: Describe your views and what APIs is used on which view. If you don't have access to the Internet Technology class Budibase environment(https://inttech.budibase.app/), please write to Devid on MS teams.

This Web application was developed using Budibase and it is available for preview at https://inttech.budibase.app/builder/app/app_dev_inttech_4e92b1b0a5324ff78ede1ee5149fa44c.

## Execution
> ðŸš§: Please describe how to execute your app and what configurations must be changed to run it. 

The codespace URL of this Repo is subject to change. Therefore, the Budibase PizzaRP webapp is not going to show any data in the view, when the URL is not updated or the codespace is offline. Follow these steps to start the webservice and reconnect the webapp to the new webservice url. 

1. Clone SportsCarRental in a new repository.
2. Start your codespace (see video guide at: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W9B7qc9lVc&ab_channel=GitHub))
3. Run the SportsCarRental main available at SportsCarRentalApplication.java on your own codespace.
4. Set your app with a public port, see the guide at [link](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace).
5. Create an own Budibase app, you can export/import the existing SportsCarRental app. Guide available at [link](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/export-and-import-apps).
6. Update the SportsCarRental URL in the datasource and publish your app.
